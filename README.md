# Cornell-AppDev-Intro-To-iOS-Development-Solutions
 
Hey üëãüèª, I made this repository to upload the code for Cornell-AppDev's Intro To iOS Development course. This is just the code that they write in the lecture videos. I watched the lectures and then wrote the code for them, it's almost identical (spelling mistakes in variables mostly :D). On their [course website](https://ios-course.cornellappdev.com) they also upload project files for some of the lectures, you can also use that instead of this. I don't own the code, I just did this because I'm learning [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/about_app_development_with_uikit). 
 
## Code

## CheckList
 
- [ ] Complete All Asssignments 
- [x] Write Bad Code
 
 
## Extra Links
 
You should definitely also check out some of the [official UIKit documentaion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/).
Also, check out how Swift works [Apple's documentation](https://swift.org/documentation/) on that is awesome.
